# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


- My implementation is very minimalist and only just covers what's required functionality
- I use four tables: users, reviews, books, and authors. the reason for separating the last two was that I was initially thinking of adding new functionality, which I haven't done so far.
- therefore the means of creating these tables is unnecessarily slow :) on my computer it takes about 5 minutes to create the books table and then the authors' table 
- I have not followed any good security best practices for handling session info, hope to learn more about that soon!
